Experimenting with changes to file
So far made changes by clicking on "Show in Explorer" in suggestions what to do next in changes tab
Then selected the "Edit with Notepad++" option from right clicking README.md file
After saved changes then its simply renembering to press the "Commit to master" in bottom left
Finally click the "push origin" option
Note to self: Lecturer recommends watching tutorials on Youtube for GitHub, will need to allocate time outside of studies 

Test 2: Need to figure out what to do next

Lecturer Says:
"You are ELEC143
At home go to getting started
This goes through testing of software
So task for next week is go through getting started and make sure that is done
You are ELEC143 Level 4, and at bottom is introduction with link to next session for week 2
All we're doing this week is getting started
We will come back after lunch just to practice going through github
So in getting started, I would say section 3 and section 4 we can do now
By all means read 1, 2 is for home and 3 and 4 we can do today
So lets get started on number 3 "testing hardware" and then move on to "testing software"
Read the notes on the web then go to files and first 2 "show explorer" which shows where we put them
Most of folders are for notes, but software is ??? (ineligible was speaking too quitely)
Oh and attendence code I will do that now, MK IO XP"
end transcript

Explanation how to do "Getting Started" task for day and for next week:
First go to "ELEC143" in "My Courses" part of DLE
Then scroll down and expand "Core Learning Materials" and look for the "Practical Session Materials for Week 1" 
Opening link, under text for "Week 1" should see "Getting Started section of the notes"
Click this read 1 then complete 3 and 4 titled "testing hardware" and "testing software" respectively 
For "Getting Started" 2 is for work at home
